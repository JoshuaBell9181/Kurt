Open project "Mariner" in Netbeans IDE.

Please ensure the 3 input files are copied to the working directory.

In Mariner\src\mariner are: 1)Driver.java 2)JsonDateConvert.java 3)Record.java

- Driver.java contains MAIN method.

- JsonDateConvert.java is for converting timestamp to date formate in CSV file

- Record.java was created to that there would be array of Record objects. Each object consists of the fields in the CSV.

- Execute the program. The output file will be finalReport.csv. It wil display in the same column order as the input CSV with dates sorted in ascending order. All packets-serviced equaling zero will be ommitted.

The project required a json simple jar library. I tried several versions of this jar and chose to keep them. I was not sure if the removal of one or more would compromise the compilation/runtime.
